### Hey, I'm Neil. I'm currently a senior at Northeastern University majoring in Computer Science. I love **creating interesting projects, solving complex problems, and building useful solutions**.

### On this website, I share my experiences building projects and the lessons I learn along the way. Whether you're a fellow student or a developer, I hope you'll find something useful here.
